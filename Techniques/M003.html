<p>This applies in a very similar way to both mouse interaction and   touch interaction, so it is not really a mobile-specific technique. </p>

<h2><span id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The objective of this technique is to prevent the unintentional   triggering of events in touch and mouse interaction. Mouse users   clicking on actionable elements (links, buttons, submit inputs) should   have the opportunity to move the cursor outside the element to prevent   the event from being triggered. This allows users to change their mind   without be forced to commit to an action. </p>
<p>In the same way, elements accessed via touch interaction should   trigger the event (navigation, submits, etc.) only when the touchend   event is fired (i.e., the user has lifted the finger off the screen AND   the last position of the finger is inside the actionable element AND   equals the position at touchstart). </p>
<h2><span id="Examples">Examples</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li> A web form for online purchasing includes a "Buy now" submit at the   end of the order form. A mouse user clicking on the submit input but   releasing the mouse button outside its boundaries will not fire the   event and thereby not commit to the action of purchasing. </li>
  <li> An app presents a "Buy now" button end of the order form. A user   using a smartphone touch screen  touching the button but lifting the   finger outside the button's boundaries will not trigger the action of   purchasing. </li>
</ul>

<h2><span id="Tests">Tests</span></h2>
<p>The test procedures for mouse and mobile interaction modes are   similar, but they differ regarding the possible availability of   secondary actions on touch devices, for example, to bring up a   contextual menu. Secondary actions may be triggered when touching an   element and continuing to hold it. The availability of such secondary   actions depends on the respective platform convention and the   implementation in the app under test. </p>
<h3><span id="Procedure_.28mouse_input_mode.29">Procedure (mouse input mode)</span></h3>
<ol>
  <li> For all actionable elements,  position mouse pointer over the element and press the mouse button down </li>
  <li> check that no action is triggered (apart from changing the visual state the element) </li>
  <li> Move mouse pointer putside the element and release the mouse button. Check that no action is triggered (e.g. on mouseleave) </li>
